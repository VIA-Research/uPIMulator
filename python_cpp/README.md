# ⚙️ Usage
## Currently Supported Mode
uPIMulator operates in an execution-driven simulation mode, enabling cycle-accurate performance analysis of PIM-based applications.

## Workflow
The typical usage workflow comprises two primary stages:

1. **Binary Generation:** Compile, assemble, and link your application code to generate the required binary files for simulation.
2. **Cycle-Level Simulation:** Utilize the generated binary files as input to the cycle-level simulator to obtain detailed performance metrics and insights.

We aim to expand uPIMulator's capabilities and may introduce additional usage modes in future releases.

## Cycle-level Simulation
### Executing a Simulation
Initiate a cycle-level simulation by providing the following inputs to the `uPIMulator` executable:

- Benchmark name
- Number of tasklets
- Absolute path to the directory containing the generated binary files (`bindir`)

You can further customize the simulation behavior using various command-line options. 

### Simulation Output
The simulation results will be printed directly to the standard output (`stdout`).

### Example Command

```bash
cd /path/to/uPIMulator/uPIMulator_backend/build/
./src/uPIMulator --benchmark VA --num_tasklets 16 --bindir /path/to/uPIMulator/uPIMulator_frontend/bin/1_dpus/ --logdir .
```

> **Important Note:** Ensure that you provide the absolute path to the `bindir` when executing the simulation.

Feel free to explore different benchmark configurations and utilize the command-line options to tailor the simulation to your specific requirements.

The spreadsheet includes instructions on how to populate it with the relevant simulation output data, and it will automatically generate the corresponding figure.

> **Important Configuration Note:** Please ensure that the number of threads is configured to **16 tasklets** when running the simulations for this figure.
> You can achieve this by using the following command-line argument: `--num_tasklets 16`.

## Figure 9: Instruction Mix (Single DPU)
<img src="../assets/uPIMulator_figure9.png" width="400"/>

Figure 9 provides a breakdown of the instruction mix observed during single-DPU execution.
To generate this figure, follow the steps outlined below using the `upmem_profiler` tool and the accompanying Excel sheet.

### Procedure

1. **Build the Profiler**

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/uPIMulator/tools/upmem_profiler/script
   bash build.sh
   ```

2. **Extract Instructions**
   Run the simulation with the `--verbose 1` flag to capture detailed instruction traces.

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/uPIMulator/python_cpp/uPIMulator_backend/
   ./build/src/uPIMulator --benchmark VA --num_tasklets 16 --bindir /path/to/uPIMulator/python_cpp/uPIMulator_frontend/bin/1_dpus/ --logdir . --verbose 1 > trace.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Profiler**
   Process the generated trace file using the `upmem_profiler` in `instruction_mix` mode.

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/uPIMulator/tools/upmem_profiler/
   ./build/src/upmem_profiler --logpath /path/to/uPIMulator/python_cpp/uPIMulator_backend/trace.txt --mode instruction_mix
   ```

4. **Generate the Figure**
   Utilize the profiler's output to populate the provided [Excel sheet](../assets/figure9_instruction_mix.xlsx), which will automatically generate the instruction mix figure.

> **Important Configuration Note:** Similar to Figure 7, the instruction mix analysis in Figure 9 is based on simulations with **16 tasklets**.
> Ensure that you maintain this configuration (`--num_tasklets 16`) for accurate replication. 

## Figure 10: Multi-DPU Latency Breakdown and Speedup
<img src="../assets/uPIMulator_figure10.png" width="400"/>

Figure 10 presents the latency breakdown and speedup achieved in multi-DPU scenarios.

### Configuring the Number of DPUs
You can adjust the number of DPUs by modifying the `num_dpus` parameter in both the `uPIMulator_frontend` and `uPIMulator_backend`.

### Generating the Latency Breakdown
To obtain the latency breakdown data for plotting, utilize the `upmem_reg_model` tool located in the `tools/upmem_reg_model/` directory.
This tool implements a communication model between the host and DPUs based on linear regression.

### Procedure

1. **Prepare Input Excel:**
   - We provide a sample input Excel file as a template.
   - Append a new row to this file, specifying the benchmark name, number of DPUs, and the `data_prep_param` used in your simulation.
   - Fill in the relevant time values (in milliseconds) obtained from your simulation results, such as kernel execution time.

2. **Run the Regression Model:**

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/uPIMulator/tools/upmem_reg_model/src
   python main.py --input_excel_filepath /path/to/your/input_excel_file --output_excel_filepath /path/to/your/output_excel_file
   ```

3. **Access the Output:** 
   - The linear regression results will be available in the specified output Excel file.
   - Use this data to create the latency breakdown plots as shown in Figure 10.

Please ensure that you follow these steps carefully to accurately reproduce the multi-DPU latency breakdown and speedup analysis presented in the paper.

# 🌋 Adding Custom Benchmarks
uPIMulator empowers you to go beyond the provided PrIM benchmark suite by incorporating your own custom benchmarks.
This is particularly beneficial if you have access to UPMEM-PIM hardware and want to evaluate your code's performance in a simulated environment.

## Requirements
To successfully integrate a new benchmark, ensure it adheres to the following:

1. **UPMEM-C Language:**  The benchmark must be implemented in UPMEM-C, a C-like language tailored for UPMEM-PIM programming.
Consult the [UPMEM SDK documentation](https://sdk.upmem.com/2021.4.0/) for detailed programming guidelines.

2. **File Structure and Naming:**  
   - Maintain the same file hierarchy as the PrIM benchmarks, including a `dpu` subdirectory.
   - Utilize the same `Makefile` structure used by the PrIM suite for automated compilation.

3. **Communication Variables:**
   - **Host-to-DPU:** Use the `DPU_INPUT_ARGUMENTS` variable for data transfer from the host to DPUs via WRAM.
   - **DPU-to-Host:**  Use the `DPU_RESULTS` variable for data transfer from DPUs to the host via WRAM.
   > **Important:** Deviating from these variable names will result in the linker ignoring the communication during the linking phase.

## Data Preparation
Once your benchmark meets the above criteria, it's ready for data input.
Since UPMEM PIM-enabled memory directly utilizes physical addresses, exercise caution when feeding input/output data. 

You'll need to provide a Python script to handle data preparation for your benchmark.
This script should reside in the `uPIMulator_frontend/src/assembler/data_prep` directory and be recognized by `uPIMulator_frontend/src/assembler/assembler.py`.

> **Key Considerations for Data Preparation Scripts: 
> - Data transferred from the host to DPUs using `dpu_push_xfer` must be organized within the `input_dpu_mram_heap_pointer_name` variable in your data preparation script.
> - Similarly, data transferred from DPUs to the host using `dpu_push_xfer` should be placed within the `output_dpu_mram_heap_pointer_name` variable.

## Reference Examples
We have included data preparation scripts for the 13 supported PrIM benchmarks.
These serve as excellent references for structuring your custom data preparation scripts.

By following these guidelines, you can seamlessly integrate your benchmarks into uPIMulator for comprehensive performance evaluation and analysis.
