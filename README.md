# üßë‚Äçüíª Released Versions
> **uPIMulator: A Flexible and Scalable Simulation Framework for General-Purpose Processing-In-Memory (PIM) Architectures**

uPIMulator is a cycle-level performance simulator tailored for general-purpose Processing-In-Memory (PIM) systems adhering to the UPMEM Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). This tool provides a detailed simulation environment, empowering computer architecture researchers and PIM program developers to investigate and harness the capabilities of PIM technology.

For comprehensive insights into uPIMulator and its applications, refer to our HPCA-2024 publication:

"[Pathfinding Future PIM Architectures by Demystifying a Commercial PIM Technology](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/hpca/2024/931300a263/1VOAAZSdy0w)", HPCA, 2024

The currently available versions are:
1. Python & C++ version
2. Go version
3. Go & virtual machine version

All source code and version history can be accessed in our GitHub repository.

## The Python & C++ Version
This is our initial implementation of uPIMulator, used in our HPCA-2024 publication. 
You'll find it in the `python_cpp` directory.  Refer to the included [README](./python_cpp/README.md) for usage instructions.

## The Go Version
Our second implementation, optimized for speed and memory efficiency.
Located in the `golang` directory, it offers an 8.5x speed increase and 7.5x memory reduction due to multi-threading.
We generally recommend this version for most use cases. See the [README](./golang/README.md) for details.

## The Go & Virtual Machine Version
This latest version extends the Go version with virtual machine capabilities, eliminating the need for manual data preparation code in many scenarios.
It's particularly suitable for complex or dynamic benchmarks where manual data preparation is challenging, though it may not offer the fastest simulation speed.
Refer to the [README](./golang_vm/README.md) for further guidance.

- Each data point represents a single kernel from the PrIM benchmark suite.
- Summary of Correlation Ratio (R¬≤) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for single- and multi-DPU simulations:

| Scenario | Total Data Points | Correlation (R¬≤) | MAE |
|---|---|---|---|
| Single DPU (no inter-DPU communication) | 710 | 98.4% | 12.0% |
| Multi-DPU (with inter-DPU communication) | 387 | 83.6% | 26.9% |

- The validation results were obtained using the Python & C++ version of uPIMulator.

# List of Supported Instructions
- uPIMulator currently supports 599 out of the 970 instructions defined in the [UPMEM-PIM ISA](https://sdk.upmem.com/2023.2.0/201_IS.html#instruction-set-architecture).
Due to limitations in the publicly available ISA documentation, support for the remaining 371 instructions is pending.
However, the currently supported instructions have been sufficient to enable functionally correct simulations of the [PrIM benchmark suite](https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/prim-benchmarks), producing results consistent with those obtained on real UPMEM-PIM hardware.

- For a detailed list of the currently supported instructions, please refer to [this Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xq8t6aRvafmTlGmy4Am8i3QmoOzli1heNxLmCEIlCv4/edit?usp=sharing).
